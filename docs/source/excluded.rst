Examples never included
=======================

Some examples are never going to be included in this project.
These are examples such as:

- importing code from an external site

There are various examples of this such as (if I recall correctly)

- importing "best answer" from StackOverflow
- installing module from pypi on request (David Beazley's talk)

etc.  I need to add some explanations and provide links to the examples
mentioned above.
