Examples that will never be included
=====================================

.. danger::

    Importing code from an external site using an import hook
    could lead to unsafe behaviour and could possibly
    cause damage on the user's computer; I want to protect users of my
    creation from such possibility.


.. sidebar:: Braces?

    I fear retribution in the form of excommunication
    from the Python community
    if I were to enable braces. ;-)

Some examples are (**most probably**) never going to be included in this project.
These are examples such as:

- Importing code from an external site.
- Any sort of use of braces to enclose a block of Python code.



.. todo:: **Add these examples**

    I need to add some explanations and provide links to the following examples:

    - importing "best answer" from StackOverflow
    - installing module from pypi on request (David Beazley's talk)

    etc.
