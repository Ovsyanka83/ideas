Examples that will never be included
=====================================

Some examples are never going to be included in this project.
These are examples such as:

- Importing code from an external site.
- Any sort of use of braces to enclose a block of Python code.

The first type of examples could lead to unsafe behaviour and could possibly
cause damage on the user's computer; I want to protect users of my
creation from such possibility.

The second type of examples could cause **me** a personal risk as I do
fear retribution in the form of excommunication from the Python community
if I were to support such initiatives. ;-)

Links to such examples done elsewhere
-------------------------------------

There are various examples of some of these (if I recall correctly)

- importing "best answer" from StackOverflow
- installing module from pypi on request (David Beazley's talk)

etc.  I need to add some explanations and provide links to the examples
mentioned above.
