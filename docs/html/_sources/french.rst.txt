French Python
==============

.. admonition:: Summary

    This example demonstrates the how to use a non-standard file
    extension (``.pyfr``) as an indication that an import hook must
    be used.

Imagine you are a French beginner who has learned the basics
of programming using a block-based environment such as Scratch
or Blockly. All the text shown on these blocks was in French,
the only language you know.  You now want to do a transition
to actually writing code in an editor, instead of putting
predefined blocks together. It would be so much easier if
you could use a version of Python where the keywords were in French,
with most of them being identical to what you were using in the
block-based environment.

This is what this import hook example allows one to do.
A more elaborate example is that given by
`AvantPy <https://aroberge.github.io/avantpy/docs/html/>`_.



En fran√ßais, svp !
