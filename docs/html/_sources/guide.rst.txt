Guide to the examples
======================

The examples included are listed roughly in increasing level of complexity.
Source transformations and AST transformations can be used interactively
in IPython/Jupyter environments;  bytecode transformations and custom
encoding cannot.

Source transformations
----------------------


nobreak as a keyword
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is a sligthly more complex example than 'function as a keyword',
as it shows how to keep track of indentation
level and only replace a keyword when some conditions are met.


repeat as a keyword
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This includes four different transformations,
one of which requires to add some extra variables to the original code.
It is done in a way that avoid any conflict with existing variable names.

It also shows how to include some parameters that are passed back to the
source transformation.

French Python
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is a source transformation that allows one
to use French equivalent keywords to the existing ones.
It shows how to make use of a different file extension (``.pyfr``),
loading such files as if they were regular Python files.

French repeat
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Extends the French keywords from **French Python** to include those
in **repeat as a keyword**. It then combines both examples into
a single transformation.

Auto-self
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is an example of a syntax that is intended to reduce
boilerplate code when initializing a class instance.
The code transformation is more complex than the previous ones and
include a change of indentation of an entire block of code.

Fractional math (token)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is a functionally equivalent version to the AST proof of concept
example [Fractional math (ast)] mentioned below.
It demonstrates how to include
supplementary code, such as importing a module or defining a function,
in addition to the user code, while ensuring that the console (REPL)
can still work properly.

Switch statement
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Implementing a switch statement as described in the rejected PEP 3103.
This example was done quite a few years ago, well before the
match statement was added to Python.

Implicit multiplication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Python's syntax does not allow to write a number followed by an
non-keyword identifier or by a parenthesis, nor does it allow to write two
non-keyword identifiers in a row. However, when writing equations on
paper, these constructs are recognized as indicating a multiplication.
This transformation does the same.

Abstract Syntax Tree transformations
------------------------------------

Fractional math (AST)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is a proof-of-concept of a transformation
at the Abstract Syntax Tree level. It also shows how to include
supplementary code, such as importing a module or defining a function,
in addition to the user code while ensuring that the console (REPL)
can still work properly.


Bytecode transformations
-------------------------

Confused math
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is a proof-of-concept demonstrating bytecode transformation.

Other types
------------

True constants
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is a fairly complex example that illustrates
the use of a custom module dict and class.

Custom encoding
---------------

Import hooks are not the only way one can transform a source; this
can also be done by custom encodings.

Î» encoding
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is an adaptation of our basic example, but using a custom
encoding which needs to be explicitly declared in a file whose
source must be transformed.
