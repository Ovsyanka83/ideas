Basic usage
-----------

Suppose that you want to use ``function`` as a keyword in Python, to mean
the same thing as ``lambda``, enabling you to write::

    # my_program.py

    square = function x: x**2
    print(f"{square(4)} is the square of 4.")

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        print(f"And the square of 5 is {square(5)}")


You can run this program in a terminal as follows::

    > python -m ideas my_program -t function_keyword
    16 is the square of 4.
    And the square of 5 is 25


The argument following ``-t`` is the name of a module that contains
a function named ``add_hook``.  A search for such a module is first
done in the current directory. If the module is not found in the
current directory, it is assumed to exists in the ``ideas.examples``
directory included with ``ideas``.

You may have noticed in the above that ``my_program`` does not
include a ``.py`` extension. This is because ``my_program`` is imported:
Python **import hooks**, by definition, only work on modules that are
imported. Yet, you may have also noticed that it is imported with
the name ``'__main__'``, so that it is run as though it is the main script.

.. sidebar:: .py extension?

    Ideas is quite forgiving. If you invoke it adding a ``.py`` extension
    to the main script, as in:

    .. code-block:: none

        > python -m ideas my_program.py -t function_keyword

    it will work the same way as if you left out the ``.py`` extension.


Using the ideas-enabled interactive console
=============================================

Ideas comes with its own interactive console.  Here's a sample session::


    > python -m ideas -t function_keyword
    Ideas Console version 0.0.31. [Python version: 3.10.2]

    >>> cube = function x: x**3
    >>> cube(3)
    27


Just like with the normal CPython console, you can run a main
script and continue with the interactive console





    # loader_1.py

    from ideas.examples import function_keyword
    function_keyword.add_hook()

    import my_program


and then run::

    python loader_1.py

The result will be::

    16 is the square of 4.



Another way to activate the hook is using either a sitecustomize.py file
(not recommended) or a temporary usercustomize.py file.  For example::

    # usercustomize.py

    from ideas.examples import function_keyword
    function_keyword.add_hook()

    print("  --> usercustomize.py was executed")


By setting the environment variable ``PYTHONPATH``, we can tell Python
to run this file first.  On Windows, this can be done as the following::

    set PYTHONPATH=%CD%

Once we have done this, if we use::

    # my_other_program.py

    import my_program

and run::

    python my_other_program.py

the result will be::

      --> usercustomize.py was executed
    16 is the square of 4.

So, we can see that our import hook has be set correctly by using
a usercustomize.py file. Unfortunately, if we attempt to do the
following, a ``SyntaxError`` will be raised::

    $ python my_program.py
      --> usercustomize.py was executed
      File "my_program.py", line 3
        square = function x: x**2
                          ^
    SyntaxError: invalid syntax

Python (cPython at least...) ignores the existence of any import hook
when executing the main script. Perhaps I should make a suggestion
to change this on Python-ideas. ;-)

However, we can do the following::

    $ python -c "import my_program"
      --> usercustomize.py was executed
    16 is the square of 4.

The only drawback of this approach is that ``my_program`` will never
be found to have its name to be ``"__main__"``.
If we want to have a program with its source transformed but run
as main, we can use a custom codec. This is described in the
"Î» encoding" example.


Using the Ideas Console
-----------------------

If you can't write code in an REPL to try it out, then you are not
using Python. So, of course ``ideas`` has to include its own (likely buggy)
version of an interpreter.


We can activate it as follows::

    $ python
    Python 3.7.3 ...

    >>> from ideas.examples import function_keyword
    >>> hook = function_keyword.add_hook()
    >>> from ideas import console
    >>> console.start()
    Configuration values for the console:
        callback_params: {'show_original': False, 'show_transformed': False}
        transform_source from ideas.examples.function_keyword
    --------------------------------------------------
    Ideas Console version 0.0.4. [Python version: 3.7.3]

    ~>> cube = function x: x**3
    ~>> cube(3)
    27
    ~>>

Alternatively, using the ``-i`` option of the standard Python
interpreter with one of our previous examples, we do not have
to write code to add our hook as it is already set::

    $ python -i loader_1.py
    16 is the square of 4.
    >>>
    >>> from ideas import console
    >>> console.start()
    Configuration values for the console:
        callback_params: {'show_original': False, 'show_transformed': False}
        transform_source from ideas.examples.function_keyword
    --------------------------------------------------
    Ideas Console version 0.0.4. [Python version: 3.7.3]

    ~>> square = function x: x**2
    ~>> square(-5)
    25
    ~>>
