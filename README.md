# importhooks
Easy creation of custom import hooks

## Motivation

As I find myself doing a lot of copy/paste/modify on the various import
hooks experiments, including on some published projects such as AvantPy,
I thought it would make sense to create a versatile projects which I could
use as the basis of other projects.  An obvious benefit is that I will
need to fix bugs in a single project.

## Warning about the name

There is already a package name `importhook` (singular) on pypi.
This package name is `importhooks` (plural), as it intends to provide
support for various types of custom hooks.


## Tools

This project uses black for formatting, pytest for running tests,
and flake8 for linting.


## To Do

- Add requirements-dev.txt file
- Add setup.py file and upload to pypi
- List cases to be included
