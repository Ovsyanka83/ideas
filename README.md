# ideas
Easy creation of custom import hooks to try out new ideas for Python.

## About the name

For this project, I was thinking of using `importhook` (singular),
but there is already a project with that name on pypi.
I was tempted to use `importhooks` (plural), but decided that it might
be too confusing.

I settle on `ideas` as I am guessing that the main application would be
for people to try out suggestions from python-ideas.

## Motivation


As I find myself doing a lot of copy/paste/modify on the various import
hooks experiments, including on some published projects such as AvantPy,
I thought it would make sense to create a versatile projects which I could
use as the basis of other projects.  An obvious benefit is that I will
need to fix bugs in a single project.


## Tools

This project uses black for formatting, pytest for running tests,
and flake8 for linting.


## To Do

- Add requirements-dev.txt file
- Add setup.py file and upload to pypi
- List cases/recipes to be included
